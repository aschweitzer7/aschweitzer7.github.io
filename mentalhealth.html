								<h2>Our Application</h2>
								<p>
									Virtually no research exists examining the daily influence of environmental factors on the development of mental health disorders such as schizophrenia. We are working with Dr. Benson Ku, a psychiatrist at Emory University, to do just this. Our solution is a mobile application that collects real-time data on the status of the user’s mental health such as their feelings and emotions in relation to their location during the day. We can compile and organize this data for our client and other clinicians to analyze and have the ability to better treat their own patients and gain knowledge of the development of mental health disorders.
								</p>
								<p>
									Most mental health mobile apps that exist focus on self help such as meditation, healthy habits, or journaling. Apps even exist to connect users to therapy options or can give insight on their symptoms and resources. Our app is unique because it takes into account a user’s location and environmental situation and connects this data to their daily input that which is not found in the current market. And although our app is research-focused, the interface itself is user-friendly and has an interactive feel instead of clinical.
								</p>
								<p>
									The application interface is intended for mental health patients to use. Typical scenarios a patient might follow are completing a daily questionnaire, viewing their progress on a calendar, and enabling location sharing. On the other hand, the result of questionnaire will be stored in the database and these data will be analyzed by the client and potentially other clinicians. Typical client scenarios include searching for a patient name, checking the survey responses or searching for an area’s coordinates.
								</p>
								<p>
									The daily questionnaire within the app will serve to prompt the user to reflect on their mental well-being. Location tracking will ideally run in the background of the user’s device, but it is important for them to update their location permissions if necessary. They can also save common locations which is helpful for the client to identify user’s recurring places that could impact their well-being. The functionality of these features will be further explored in our demo video.

								<h2>Semester 2 Work (Ongoing)</h2>
								<p>Core Client Deliverables: Demo Videos for Coding Sprints, GitHub Source Code Delivery, Publication to the App Store and Google Play Store.</p>
								<p>
									Semester 2 of the project (Jan. 2022 - Apr. 2022) focuses on project implementation such as programming the application, providing our client with an interactive database, and refining UI/UX designs and branding such as an app logo and testing for optimal user experience.
								</p>
								
								
								<h2>Technologies and Tools</h2>
								<p>
									Designs for the user interface of the mobile application are created using Figma, to be referenced during front-end app development. React Native is an open-source JavaScript framework that our team is using for developing our mobile application on both iOS and Android platforms. Information is stored in the database MongoDB.
